## R Markdown

`mtry` must be found empirically for a dataset and has a big effect on accuracy
`ntree` "can be as large as you like, and continues to increases the accuracy up to some point. It is less difficult or critical to tune and could be limited more by compute time available more than anything."

random search for mtry
```{r}
# Random Search
control <- trainControl(method="repeatedcv", number=10, repeats=3, search="random")
set.seed(seed)
mtry <- sqrt(ncol(x))
rf_random <- train(Class~., data=dataset, method="rf", metric=metric, tuneLength=15, trControl=control)
print(rf_random)
plot(rf_random)
```
